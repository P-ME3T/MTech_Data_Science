A company has thirteen existing factories with 600 to 3500 units of supply. Four of these factories will be closed and new factories with 5000 units of supply will be located in 2 of their 148 customer sites. 
Which existing factories should be closed, and which new sites should be selected to minimize total shipping costs if customer demand cannot be split between factories?

# Dataset:

1)Factories: It consists of 13 supply locations' data including capacity for individual location.
2)Customers: It consists of 148 demand locations' data including the average requirement for individual.
3)Location_data: It provides the lattitude and longitude of all the demand and supply locations for computing cost matrix for transportation problem.
4)WorldOil: It provides the monthly requirement of certain geographical locations for reference and understanding demand distribution.
